Pyjamask-96 Encryption Module: This Verilog implementation focuses on the encryption block of the lightweight Pyjamask-96 cipher. It processes a 96-bit plaintext and a 128-bit key to produce a 96-bit ciphertext, utilizing the substitution-permutation network (SPN) architecture. Pyjamask was designed by Dahmun Goudarzi (PQShield), Jérémy Jean (ANSSI), Stefan Kölbl (CyberCrypt), Thomas Peyrin (Nanyang Technological University), Matthieu Rivain (CryptoExperts), Yu Sasaki (NTT Secure Platform Laboratories), and Siang Meng Sim (Nanyang Technological University) which is optimized for resource-constrained environments like IoT and embedded systems, providing efficient and secure encryption.
